# What is this?
We try to extract some audio features from frog recordings using Python. 

The results are including waveplot, zero-crossing-rate, linear-freq spectogram, log-freq spectogram, power spectrum, MFCCs, delta MFCCs, and delta-delta MFCCs.

This is an on-going research on bioacoustics analysis of frogs identification based on their audio features. The next step will employ machine learning both in training and identification within audio recordings.

I am open to discussion and collaboration. Thank you!
